This was a basic intro to stuff we have already done before. Learnt what **LangGraph** means and how to setup **LangSmith Studio**, which is a **custom IDE** for viewing and testing agents.

Changes:

* Changed the prompts in **basics.ipynb**

## Module 1

### Video 1: Motivation

Learnt that **Agent** is the control flow defined by **LLM**. Increasing **level of control** given to LLM drops the **reliability**. **LangGraph** is used to increase reliability when giving more control to LLM.

### Video 2: Simple Graph

[https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/DJ-22-langgraph-MAT496/blob/main/notebooks/module-1/simple-graph.ipynb]()

Learnt how to make a simple **graph** using **StateGraph()**. Graph decides next **conditional** step based on the parameters set, in this case random chance.

Changes:

* Changed the conditional statement in graph
* Added 3 options instead of 2

### Video 3: LangSmith Studio

[https://github.com/MAT496-Monsoon2025-SNU/DJ-22-langgraph-MAT496/blob/main/notebooks/module-1/simple.py]()

Learnt how to work with LangSmith Studio and use it to visualize the graph that were originally being seen in Jupyter notebook.

Changes:

* Updated simple.py to contain the graph that was made in simple-graph.ipynb
